This is a collection of ad hoc Node.js scripts I wrote to process MP4 files.

It includes:

*	`chapterrific` — concatenates MP4 files into one (with chapter markers) using a combination of
	tools from FFmpeg, GPAC and AtomicParsley.
*	`episodium` — renames MP4 files and adds metadata using AtomicParsley.
*	`mixtapes` — remix portions of MP4 files using a combination of tools from FFmpeg, GPAC and
	AtomicParsley.
